# K3P-website
This website was created using next js and firebase for the Codeissance hackathon 2022 organised in my college. It's purpose is to let authorities effectively manage disaster and crime incidents while being connected to an app which my team had also developed. I worked on the design and front-end part of it. I also helped develop the ideas for the project along with my team of 3 other members
